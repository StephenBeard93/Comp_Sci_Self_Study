I achieved the equivilant of an A+ in this 10 credit university masters course, which was an introduction to programming course which focused primarily on teaching the basics of programming, initially using C for the first three weeks, before changing paradime to Java for the remainder of the eight week course. I read the first five chapters of 'The C Book' which I thoroughly enjoyed, though my actual course didn't go into the details of pointers and memory allocation. I've since studied (and done projects in) MIPS, and I intend to build some projects in C that require pointer and memory allocation. Java was my first exposure to a true object orientated language, and once I got used to the basics I could see why OOP is extremely helpful in forcing one to code more moudular and maintainbale code, even if it is very verbose!
