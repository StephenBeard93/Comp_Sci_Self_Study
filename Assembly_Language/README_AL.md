I wanted to understand what was going on at a much lower level so I decided to study an assembly language. For my general background reading I read the first three chapters of 'Computer Organisation and Design' by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy. I had to read this very slowly as it was a lot of new concepts, but I learned a huge amount about the different types of memory, clock cycles, istructions, registers, twos compliment binnary and bitwise operations. With a grounding in the theory I then watched a free series of tuturial videos by Amell Peralta to learn MIPS. I downloaded the Mars emulator and did each of the exercises myself after wathcing the video to learn the syntax. I really enjoyed getting a lower level understanding through MIPS, though as soon as my tic tac toe project began to get more complex I realised how much more challenging writting in assembly language is compared to a higher level language!
